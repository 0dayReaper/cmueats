        <h1>How did we make this?</h1>
        <p>CmuEats was made with loving care at <a href='http://www.hackcmu.com/'>Hack CMU 2013</a>, which was hosted by Carnegie Mellon University's <a href="http://acmatcmu.org/">ACM</a> chapter.  The team consisted of <a href="http://www.oscarbezi.com">Oscar Bezi</a>, Justin Gallagher, and Kirn Hans, all freshmen.  The front end is built with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and the back end is running on  <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  We are hosting on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
